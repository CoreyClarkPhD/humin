<h1>Assignment 3: Minecraft Factory Planner: Sleepy Town needs Books</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Your first order for Sleepy Town was so successful, that they are coming back to get more items made by you and your lumberjack team. Sleepy Town needs 20 Books. Letâ€™s use the Minecraft Factory Planner to see just what materials you will need to fulfill this order.</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <div>

        </td>
        <td>
            <p>1.&nbsp; In the Planner tool find the Books in the Materials Tab, under Craftable filter. Drag and drop this item onto the Planner.</p>
        </td>

        </td>
        <td>
            <p>2. The recipe for Books is Leather, Paper and Sugar Cane. In the Materials Tab, under the Resource and Craftable filter, find Leather, Paper and Sugar Cane. Drag them on the Planner.</p>

            </div>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>1. To estimate the number, we need to add an output block for Books to the planner. Find the Books in the materials tab, under Output and drag it to the Planner.</p>

            </div>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>4. Now that you have the Output focused, you can look to see how many Books can be made every hour by click on the &ldquo;Graph&rdquo; button in the Data Window.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>

            </div>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>5. Now lets see how many Leather and Paper are needed to generate 20 Books every hour. Adjust the number in the Sugar Cane, Leather and Paper blocks until you see 20 in the Books block.</p>
