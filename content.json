This paper introduces Fast Random Genetic Search (FRGS), a genetic algorithm which is characterized by a small active population, a crossover technique which produces only one child, dynamic mutation rates, elitism, and restrictions on revisiting solutions. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of FRGS against a static AI and a dynamic AI using the Portfolio Greedy Search (PGS) algorithm. In the context of the popular Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game, StarCraft, this paper shows the advantages of FRGS in combat scenarios up to the maximum size of 200 vs. 200 units under a 40 ms time constraint.","categories":[{"name":"Research","slug":"Research","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Research/"},{"name":"Publications","slug":"Research/Publications","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Research/Publications/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Variable neighborhood search for reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks","slug":"research/publications/Variable-neighborhood-search-for-reverse-engineering-of-gene-regulatory-networks","date":"2018-11-24T04:02:12.000Z","updated":"2018-12-02T16:53:09.873Z","comments":true,"path":"Research/Publications/research/publications/Variable-neighborhood-search-for-reverse-engineering-of-gene-regulatory-networks.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/Research/Publications/research/publications/Variable-neighborhood-search-for-reverse-engineering-of-gene-regulatory-networks.html","excerpt":"","text":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics Volume 65, January 2017, Pages 120-131 A new search heuristic, Divided Neighborhood Exploration Search, designed to be used with inference algorithms such as Bayesian networks to improve on the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks is presented.

Despite its success, many HC projects struggle to expand their user base and create sustained user engagement. In contrast, the commercial video game industry overall is very successful at encouraging users to spend significant time and resources to play over extended stretches of time, using techniques such as gameplay loops to engage players on many levels. When integrating scientific research into a video game, ideally the HC activities fit naturally within the gameplay loops and overall game themes, which game developers are best suited to accomplish. The authors propose a new HC to Video Games (HCtVG) model and associated framework, which provides a common means to connect HC research and video game developers. The HCtVG model comprises two major phases: Deconstruction and Analysis (DA) done by the researchers, and Game Integration (GI) completed by the game developers. During the DA, researchers deconstruct their research into a 5-Step Analysis Structure (5SAS) consisting of Suggest, Validate, Process, Select, and Exit steps. The 5SAS allows game developers to perform the GI phase, using the guidelines provided to integrate the HC activity into the gameplay and theme. This structure allows scientists to focus on their domain expertise while leveraging the skills of the game development community to design their video game integration. To demonstrate the HCtVG model, the authors apply the DA phase to an HC project seeking the discovery of chemotherapeutic co-medication properties for multi-drug resistant cancer research, and use the GI phase to design and integrate the HC activity into the popular game Minecraft.","categories":[{"name":"Research","slug":"Research","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Research/"},{"name":"Publications","slug":"Research/Publications","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Research/Publications/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Brian Rust","slug":"people/rust-brian","date":"2018-11-24T03:57:47.000Z","updated":"2018-11-24T04:00:03.400Z","comments":true,"path":"About/People/people/rust-brian.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/About/People/people/rust-brian.html","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"About","slug":"About","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/"},{"name":"People","slug":"About/People","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/People/"}],"tags":[{"name":"people","slug":"people","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/people/"}]},{"title":"Victoria Smith","slug":"people/smith-victoria","date":"2018-11-24T03:57:40.000Z","updated":"2018-11-24T04:00:03.400Z","comments":true,"path":"About/People/people/smith-victoria.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/About/People/people/smith-victoria.html","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"About","slug":"About","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/"},{"name":"People","slug":"About/People","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/People/"}],"tags":[{"name":"people","slug":"people","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/people/"}]},{"title":"Grduate Student (PhD, MS)","slug":"people/positions/Grduate-Student-PhD-MS","date":"2018-11-24T03:57:26.000Z","updated":"2018-11-24T03:59:22.264Z","comments":true,"path":"About/Open-Positions/people/positions/Grduate-Student-PhD-MS.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/About/Open-Positions/people/positions/Grduate-Student-PhD-MS.html","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"About","slug":"About","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/"},{"name":"Open Positions","slug":"About/Open-Positions","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/Open-Positions/"}],"tags":[{"name":"open position","slug":"open-position","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/open-position/"},{"name":"phd","slug":"phd","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/phd/"},{"name":"masters","slug":"masters","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/masters/"}]},{"title":"Post Doctoral Fellowship","slug":"people/positions/Post-Doctoral-Fellowship","date":"2018-11-24T03:57:01.000Z","updated":"2018-11-24T03:58:55.711Z","comments":true,"path":"About/Open-Positions/people/positions/Post-Doctoral-Fellowship.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/About/Open-Positions/people/positions/Post-Doctoral-Fellowship.html","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"About","slug":"About","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/"},{"name":"Open Positions","slug":"About/Open-Positions","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/About/Open-Positions/"}],"tags":[{"name":"open position","slug":"open-position","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/open-position/"},{"name":"post doc","slug":"post-doc","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/post-doc/"}]},{"title":"Codex: Lost Words of Atlantis","slug":"games/codex","date":"2018-11-24T03:43:07.000Z","updated":"2018-12-01T07:07:18.470Z","comments":true,"path":"Games/Codex/games/codex.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/Games/Codex/games/codex.html","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"Games","slug":"Games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/"},{"name":"Codex","slug":"Games/Codex","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/Codex/"}],"tags":[{"name":"games","slug":"games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/games/"},{"name":"xprize","slug":"xprize","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/xprize/"},{"name":"literacy","slug":"literacy","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/literacy/"},{"name":"education","slug":"education","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/education/"}]},{"title":"Eye in the Sky","slug":"games/eye-in-the-sky","date":"2018-11-24T03:42:56.000Z","updated":"2018-12-02T04:46:46.722Z","comments":true,"path":"Games/Eye-in-the-Sky/games/eye-in-the-sky.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/Games/Eye-in-the-Sky/games/eye-in-the-sky.html","excerpt":"","text":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans can be used to diagnose and evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments and therapies for patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of severe visual impairment in the developed world. While there are treatments for some forms of wet AMD there is nothing to help the vast majority of patients suffering from the dry or degenerative form of AMD. One of the major obstacles in the development of an effective treatment is the inability to detect objective criteria that would either herald further progression of the disease or identify aspects that suggest improvement in patients undergoing treatment. While automated evaluation procedures exist, AMD OCT analysis often requires verification or modification by a trained OCT evaluator. With millions of OCT scans performed per year, demand for new evaluation approaches increases. As part of AMD, collagen and phospholipid vesicles known as drusen form between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch’s membrane (BM). Below is a visual of an OCT retina scan and all of the layers that are present in each image While there is no cure for AMD, some treatments have shown promise in slowing disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AMD. Human computation has proven to be an effective way to crowdsource a variety of scientific problems, as well as leverage human pattern-recognition ability. Video games allow users to interact with the scientific data while also leveraging the elements game developers require to maintain engagement. Eye in the Sky: Defender is a human computation game developed in partnership with BALANCED Media | Technology and deployed on HEWMEN platform to train players to evaluate AMD OCT images, by having players identify the RPE and BM as well as subretinal drusenoid deposits. Below is a trailer/tutorial of the human compuation video game. You can download and play the game by going to http://join.hewmen.com In early prototype testing, results indicate individual players decreased their mean error score on a previously unknown image by 92.7% after 7 attempts. Averaging players’ input produced a decrease in mean error of 98.3% from a players initial image. These results suggest Human Computation games can train users to analyze AMD and OCT scans, encouraging expanded research. The goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of each player the first time they analyzed a specific image. This allowed us to evaluate the learning rate of each player as they progressed to each new level. Below is a graph of the average error on each players first attempt to identify Bruch’s membrane boundry in the retina. An interactive verision of the image can be found here. the graph showed that players were able to quickly identify the boundary and after aproximately 7 levels (about 15-20 minutes of gameplay) they were identifying the boundary within the acceptable accuracy range. A comparision between Level 1 and Level 7 can be seen below as well. The average error rate between the two images show that once players reached level 7, they results were within 1-2 pixels of the desired boundary.","categories":[{"name":"Games","slug":"Games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/"},{"name":"Eye in the Sky","slug":"Games/Eye-in-the-Sky","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/Eye-in-the-Sky/"}],"tags":[{"name":"games","slug":"games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/games/"},{"name":"retina","slug":"retina","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/retina/"},{"name":"macular degeneration","slug":"macular-degeneration","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/macular-degeneration/"},{"name":"hcg","slug":"hcg","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/hcg/"},{"name":"HEWMEN","slug":"HEWMEN","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/HEWMEN/"},{"name":"funded","slug":"funded","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/funded/"},{"name":"research","slug":"research","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/research/"}]},{"title":"Wiley Wizard","slug":"games/wiley-wizard","date":"2018-11-24T03:42:44.000Z","updated":"2018-12-01T07:57:38.488Z","comments":true,"path":"Games/Wiley-Wizard/games/wiley-wizard.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/Games/Wiley-Wizard/games/wiley-wizard.html","excerpt":"","text":"Chemotherapeutic co-medications for multi-drug resistant cancer are used to increase the efficacy of chemothereputics. Our core objective was to determine a method to identify properties of successful co-medications. Co-medication research is relatively new, so little data exists to identify good candidates from a cohort of existing drugs. Even with some eliminations/reductions, over 5 million potential co-medications need evaluation. In early research, our collaborators at the SMU Center for Drug, Discovery, Design and Delivery purchased 71 medications and tested them as potential co-medications, with 23 showing some success and the remaining 48 not. Each drug has 30 properties specifically relating to the compound and over 100 additional properties related to how the compound performed in vitro. For the initial problem, the researchers seek a way to determine commonalities in the 23 successful drugs in order to create a system to identify new co-medication candidates. To tackle this problem, the property analysis was broken into microtask that were compatiable for Human Compuation Gaming (HCG). This task strcture was modeled after k-means clustering and allowed players to manual adjust centroids for two clusters on 2 dimensions (co-medication properites) at a time. The image below showed the proof of concept interface used to develop the interaction model.
