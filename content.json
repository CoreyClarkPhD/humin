coherence tomography (OCT) scans can be used to diagnose and evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments and therapies for patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of severe visual impairment in the developed world. While automated evaluation procedures exist, AMD OCT analysis often requires verification or modification by a trained OCT evaluator. With millions of OCT scans performed per year, demand for new evaluation approaches increases. As part of AMD, collagen and phospholipid vesicles known as drusen form between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch’s membrane (BM). While there is no cure for AMD, some treatments have shown promise in slowing disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AMD. Human computation has proven to be an effective way to crowdsource a variety of scientific problems, as well as leverage human pattern-recognition ability. Video games allow users to interact with the scientific data while also leveraging the elements game developers require to maintain engagement. Eye in the Sky: Defender is a human computation game developed and deployed on HEWMEN platform to train players to evaluate AMD OCT images, by having players identify the RPE and BM as well as subretinal drusenoid deposits. Below is a trailer of the human compuation video game. You can download and play the game by going to http://hewmen.io/alpha/ In early prototype testing, results indicate individual players decreased their mean error score on a previously unknown image by 92.7% after 7 attempts. Averaging players’ input produced a decrease in mean error of 98.3% from a players initial image. These results suggest Human Computation games can train users to analyze AMD and OCT scans, encouraging expanded research. The goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of each player the first time they analyzed a specific image. This allowed us to evaluate the learning rate of each player as they progressed to each new level. Below is a graph of the average error on each players first attempt to identify Bruch’s membrane boundry in the retina. An interactive verision of the image can be found here. the graph showed that players were able to quickly identify the boundary and after aproximately 7 levels (about 15-20 minutes of gameplay) they were identifying the boundary within the acceptable accuracy range. A comparision between Level 1 and Level 7 can be seen below as well. The average error rate between the two images show that once players reached level 7, they results were within 1-2 pixels of the desired boundary.","categories":[{"name":"Games","slug":"Games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/"},{"name":"Eye in the Sky","slug":"Games/Eye-in-the-Sky","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/categories/Games/Eye-in-the-Sky/"}],"tags":[{"name":"games","slug":"games","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/games/"},{"name":"hcg","slug":"hcg","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/hcg/"},{"name":"HEWMEN","slug":"HEWMEN","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/HEWMEN/"},{"name":"funded","slug":"funded","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/funded/"},{"name":"research","slug":"research","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/research/"},{"name":"retina","slug":"retina","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/retina/"},{"name":"macular degeneration","slug":"macular-degeneration","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/tags/macular-degeneration/"}]},{"title":"Wiley Wizard","slug":"games/wiley-wizard","date":"2018-11-24T03:42:44.000Z","updated":"2018-12-01T07:05:04.995Z","comments":true,"path":"Games/Wiley-Wizard/games/wiley-wizard.html","link":"","permalink":"http://HuMInGameLab.com/Games/Wiley-Wizard/games/wiley-wizard.html","excerpt":"","text":"Chemotherapeutic co-medications for multi-drug resistant cancer are used to increase the efficacy of chemothereputics. Our core objective was to determine a method to identify properties of successful co-medications. Co-medication research is relatively new, so little data exists to identify good candidates from a cohort of existing drugs. Even with some eliminations/reductions, over 5 million potential co-medications need evaluation. In early research, our collaborators at the SMU Center for Drug, Discovery, Design and Delivery purchased 71 medications and tested them as potential co-medications, with 23 showing some success and the remaining 48 not. Each drug has 30 properties specifically relating to the compound and over 100 additional properties related to how the compound performed in vitro. For the initial problem, the researchers seek a way to determine commonalities in the 23 successful drugs in order to create a system to identify new co-medication candidates. To tackle this problem, the property analysis was broken into microtask that were compatiable for Human Compuation Gaming (HCG). This task strcture was modeled after k-means clustering and allowed players to manual adjust centroids for two clusters on 2 dimensions (co-medication properites) at a time. The image below showed the proof of concept interface used to develop the interaction model. The above interface was then converted into the Twin Stick Shooter HCG Wiley Wizard, developed by BALANCED Media | Technology, and deployed on the HEWMEN platform. Below is a trailer of the gameplay from Wiley Wizard The initial results obtained from Wiley Wizard allowed us to evaluate the methodology for integration and evalution of human computation for both custom and commercial video games.
